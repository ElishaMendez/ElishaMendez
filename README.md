## 👋 Hey, I’m Eli

I’m a senior at the University of Central Florida finishing my B.G.S. in General Studies with a Minor in Health Administration. I have a strong background in pharmacy operations and scheduling analysis, and I’m working toward becoming a healthcare analyst.
I’m especially interested in healthcare operations—workflow optimization, scheduling, inventory management, and anything that involves data analytics.

## 🔧 What I’m Currently Working On
I’m building my skills in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, and learning how to use GitHub to share and track the projects I’m creating along the way.

## 🌐 Coming Soon
I’m also working on a personal portfolio website where I’ll showcase my projects and experience.
